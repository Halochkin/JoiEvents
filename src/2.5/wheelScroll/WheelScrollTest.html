   Passive and active event listeners

   If you assume that you ALWAYS specify your event listeners to the specific part of the DOM,
   ie. make one function for one element to react and another function for another element to react,
   then you can use the passive: true/false option to control how the order of the event cascade at the same time
   you add the event listener. But. This pattern breaks down as soon as you want to add ONE js function on a container
   element that should make a decision based on which element/branch of the DOM is used. We can call such a function
   a "generalized event listener" or "multi-element event listener".

   You might say that you shouldn't use multi-element event listeners. That you should always split your event functions
   into pieces for different elements. Ie. the elements are always the primary mechanism for dividing event functionality,
   the event itself is never the primary mechanism for dividing event functionality. That is wrong. Stupid. And counter
   productive. Events are a primary method of organizing code. Event functionality might be highly consistent, while
   the elements using or binding to such functionality might be highly fluid.

   Instead, the alternative is to view the event functionality as two-fold:
   1. the event function itself is one thing,
   2. the act of "blocking" the native event cascade (of scrolling)
      (ie. active event listener calling preventDefault()),
      is a another thing.

   Thus, for events that use "passive: true" in any meaningful way, you:
    1. make your main event function as passive, always.
    2. For the elements and branches in the DOM where you need to call preventDefault(),
       you add an active event listener that ONLY calls preventDefault().
    2b. If you need to check some state, and if that state needs to be controlled via the main event function,
       you use an HTML attribute or CSS class or custom CSS property to specify if or not an element should be active
       or passive. The active event listener can then check this property, and use this to decide if or not to call preventDefault().

    x. It would have been MUCH MUCH better if active/passive event listeners did not exist. It would be MUCH MUCH better
       if the browsers only relied on either a CSS property or an HTML attribute to control the order of the native EventCascade
       ie. "scroll-event: scroll-before-wheel-propagation" or "scroll-event: wheel-propagation-before-scroll".

       So, the trick is to imagine that you have such an HTML attribute, and then implement this attribute using
       passive: false event listeners that either call or do not call `.preventDefault()`.
