todo write a chapter here about marking an element with an attribute, and this makes an event only active on the elements marked in this way.

then, the reverse globalization can come after this one. And then reverse globalization doesn't have to consider ListenUp, because it doesn't really make that much difference for the listenUp. The biggest efficiency gain for reverseGlobal is to avoid having to listen for the initial event for all elements.

ReverseGlobal must handle both type-filtered and attribute-filtered events
