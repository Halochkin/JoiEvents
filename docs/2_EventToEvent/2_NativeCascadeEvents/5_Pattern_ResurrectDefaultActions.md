## BrowserActions

In this chapter we will create a list of all know DefaultActions. We will then try to reproduce them from JS.

defaultAction | trigger event | context premise | can be preventDefault()? | JS reproduction 
---|---|---|---|---
 navigation | click | on a link | yes | location = "bbc.com"
 show context menu | contextmenu | generated by an `isTrusted` right button mouse or touch long-press event or keydown context menu key) | show the context menu | NO

## Native CascadingEvents

 trigger event | cascade event | context premise | preventable |  
---|---|---|---
click | submit event | left button on input type="submit" in a form | yes | formElement.dispatchEvent(new SubmitEvent());??
contextmenu event | click | right button |  | irreplicable?
