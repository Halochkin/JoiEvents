  Why the closed-mode shadowDOM breaks, and cannot be used?

  When a composed: true event such as a click happens inside a closed shadowDOM,
  then from the lightDOM it is not possible to see the composedPath() *inside* the shadowDOM.
  If the shadowDOM contains different elements, and one of these elements has a default action,
  then there is no means to see if/which the element with the default action is clicked.

  This means that when an upper DOM context needs to evaluate if it can add a default action,
  it has no way of knowing if there is another default action already added "nearer the target".

  The only way to see this is either to add information about a default action added already to the
  event object (event.hasDefault() or something similar) or by examining the full composedPath().

<script>
  class ClosedComp extends HTMLElement {
    constructor() {
      super();
      const shadow = this.attachShadow({mode: "closed"});
      shadow.innerHTML = `<h1>Hello </h1> <a href="#uncertainty">sunshine</a>`;
    }
  }
  customElements.define("closed-comp", ClosedComp);

  class WebComp extends HTMLElement {
    constructor() {
      super();
      this.attachShadow({mode: "open"});
      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `<closed-comp></closed-comp><div>I have a click action</div>`;
      this.shadowRoot.addEventListener("click", this._onClick.bind(this));
    }

    _onClick(e){
      console.log(e.composedPath()); //would not allow me to look inside the shadowRoot.
      // e.hasDefaultAction();//doesn't exist.
      debugger;

      //here I would like to add a default action, but I do not have any way of knowing if the click event
      //already contains a default action from the click hitting the link (which I would not like to override)
      //or has no default action, in which case I would like to add a default action.
      //This irreconcilably breaks when
      // a) the needs of adding default action for custom web components and
      // b) closed-mode shadowRoot restrictions meets.
      // When there was a way to identify *if* a native default action exist for an event,
      // then the closed-mode shadowRoot could be reinstated, successfully.

      // The composed: true events should instead bounce.
      // In such instances, the default action would simply be appended from the inner DOM context to the event
      // dispatched on the outer.
    }
  }
  customElements.define("web-comp", WebComp);
