# WhatIs: `submit`?

Some events such as `submit` only have *one* possible default action. They are simple. Likeable. And we say that these events-to-defaultAction pairs conform to a OneEventToOneAction pattern.

So. What does these events look like inside? How can we make such events in JS? And what does the function that control them look like?
