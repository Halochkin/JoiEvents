The main DOM:
=============
&lt;open-comp>
  &lt;div>
    light DOM
    &lt;input type="checkbox">
  &lt;/div>
&lt;/open-comp>

The flattened DOM:
==================
  open-comp             \       -   (event listener: doesn't run)
    $shadowRoot          \     *  (event listener: calls stopPropagation())
       $slot              \   /
         div               \ /
           input[checkbox]  *   (event listener: print)

(true propagation path when you click on and "change" the checkbox)


The developer's DOM
==================
  open-comp           \   -    (event listener: doesn't run)
    div                \ /
       input[checkbox]  *    (event listener: print)

(the perceived propagation path from the point of view of the main DOM developer)

1. you never want to listen for events that come from the slot element. This will be very confusing.
you might torpedo the outside propagation causing confusion.
you might prevent default on something you shouldn't. You might listen to events you didn't expect would come.
you might forget that you will not get composed: false events from the slot. These can only be gotten in the
2. instead, you should either add the listener as a default action, like the `click` in an `< a href>`
3. or, you should add the event listener on the host node, in connectedCallback()/and remove in disconnectedCallback()
